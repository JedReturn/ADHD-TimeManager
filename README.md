How the App Works
1. Task Entry
You input tasks using the following fields:
ID (e.g. “Clean Kitchen”)


Type (Work, Chore, Misc, etc.)


Priority (1–4)


Estimated Time (EST) (minutes, time slot, or time range)


Chain (e.g. A[0], A[1] to indicate order)


2. Time Ratio Selection
You set how you want to divide your time (e.g. 50% Work, 25% Chores, 25% Misc) using a pie chart or slider.
 The app will:
Suggest tasks to fit the ratio


Warn you when a category is trailing behind


Let you rebalance tasks or expectations as the day progresses


3. Timers & Alerts
You can:
Start a timer for a task or task type


Break down longer durations (e.g. 1 hour into three 20-minute alerts)


Choose whether to be notified or continue uninterrupted


Pause/resume or stop a timer and record the actual time


The app records actual time per task for future analysis.
4. Chains
Tasks can be chained in a sequence (e.g. Cook → Clean Kitchen). These:
Can be within or across types


It should be simple to reorder via drag-and-drop or shortcut keys


Can trigger alerts (e.g. “A[1] is ready to start”)



Example Use Case
You plan to split your day into:
Work – 50%


Chores – 25%


Miscellaneous – 25%


Here’s your task list:

ID,Type,Priority,EST,Chain
Vaccum,Chore,2,20,None
Cook,Chore,1,18/30,A[0]
CleanKitchen,Chore,2,20,A[1]
Exercise,Misc,3,10,B[0]
Journal,Misc,4,10,C[2]
Walk,Misc,2,30,None
Shower,Misc,1,15,B[1]
CheckEmails,Work,2,9-9:15,None
WriteTests,Work,2,40,None
Meeting,Work,1,12-13,C[0]
Brainstorm,Work,4,30,C[1]
DesignSlide,Work,2,90,None

This gives:
Work: 235 min


Chores: 70 min


Misc: 65 min
 Total = 370 min (6 hours 10 mins)
 Actual ratio ≈ 47% / 19% / 17%
 This is slightly off from your 50/25/25 goal, so you may adjust task distribution or expectations.



How the Day Unfolds
9:00 – Start with “Check Emails” (done in 9 mins instead of 15)


9:10 – “Exercise” and “Shower” (done by 9:40)


Time saved from email covers untracked drying time


Work is now lagging, so you choose to “WriteTests”


Task is interrupted by a call, finishes by 11:00 but timer shows 45 mins total


Work/Chore/Misc = 54/18/12 (approx)
 Ratio = 9:3:2 – close to target


Later:
Meeting runs late


You complete “Brainstorm” and “Journal”


Tasks left: “DesignSlide”, “Walk”, and chained chores


Time left before dinner block = ~2 hours


You now know:
All priority tasks are completed


You have spare time to add back missed or optional tasks


Your ratios may be slightly off, but the day still worked



Reflection
At the end of the day:
You can see what took longer/shorter


The app suggests adjustments for next time (e.g. “Showers take 25 mins on average”)


Even if the ratio isn’t perfect (e.g. 300/90/60), all key tasks were completed


You feel in control, less anxious, and more adaptable



Benefits
Flexible yet structured scheduling


Reduced anxiety from missed tasks or disruptions


Balanced task focus, avoiding neglect from hyperfocus


Long-term learning through daily reflections and timing data
